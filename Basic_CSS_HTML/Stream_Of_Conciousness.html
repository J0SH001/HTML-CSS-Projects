		I didn't know what I should write about for this assignment so I thought about just typing in random characters with no rhyme or reason.<br>
		Then I thought that I should put a little more effort into this but I don't want to focus too much on the contents beacause that isn't really the point of this. <br>
		So I decided to write my thoughts about what I should write about in a <span style="color:blue;">stream of conciousness&copy</span> type of text
